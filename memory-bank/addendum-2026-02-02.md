This file has been archived. See `archive/memory-bank/addendum-2026-02-02.md` for the original addendum content and details on test-suite reorganization.


- Moved Playwright/browser-based tests from `tests/` into `tests/e2e/` to separate E2E/UI tests from unit tests.
  - Files moved (examples):
    - boot.test.mjs
    - memory_debug_test.mjs
    - debug_boot_sequence.mjs
    - debug_rom_loading.mjs
    - debug_state_dump.spec.mjs
    - simple_instruction_test.mjs
    - (and other Playwright specs previously under `tests/`)

- Added marker comments to each moved E2E test to clarify intent:
  - `// @e2e @ui` at the top of each file to label as end-to-end UI tests.

- Kept and retained unit tests (Vitest) under `tests/`:
  - test_z80_new_ops.mjs
  - test_z80_ed_fallback.mjs
  - test_z80_stack_and_ed_returns.mjs (this one is a node script; recommended to convert to Vitest for automated runs)
  - These are considered // @unit tests and were left in place.

- Removed temporary classification artifact file (`tests/CLASSIFICATION_REPORT.md`) after actions were completed and committed.

- All moves and edits were committed to the repository. No test runners were executed as part of this change.

Rationale and notes:
- Separating E2E (Playwright) tests from unit tests avoids test-runner conflicts (Vitest vs Playwright) and makes CI configuration clearer.
- Adding explicit tags (`@e2e @ui`, `@unit`) helps maintainers quickly identify test intent and select appropriate runners.
- The node-style script `test_z80_stack_and_ed_returns.mjs` can be converted to Vitest format in future to enable automated unit runs.

Recommended follow-ups:
- Update CI to run `npm run test:unit` (Vitest) and `npm run test:e2e` (Playwright) as separate jobs.
- Convert legacy node-test scripts to Vitest where appropriate.
- Optionally add a brief README in `tests/e2e/` describing how to run E2E tests (server requirements, ports, commands).
